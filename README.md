# Django_one

This is my first solo project. This is my little project that I didn't even get a name for)
Basically this application lets you fill you "shopping list" so you can decide for yourself 
where can you get all you need for best price (using Silpo API, and parsing Rykavuchka and 
ATB with Selenium)
