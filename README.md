# Django_one

This is my first solo project that I didn't even get a name for)). 
Basically this application lets you fill you "shopping list", allows you to compare prices for each product separately, so you can decide for yourself 
where you can get all you need for best price OR what shop you can go to save both time and money (using Silpo API, and parsing Rykavuchka and 
ATB with Selenium)
